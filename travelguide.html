                 hill stations in India,
                  Manali is a amidst the 
                  mountain slopes, with spell-binding 
                  views, charming streams, fairy-tale-like fog surrounding little hidden cottages and a lingering scent of pines and freshness.

            <h1>WHEN TO ESCAPE</h1>
            <p>Whether to escape from blistering heat or enjoy the white winters, here's a monthly breakup of Manali's climatic conditions so that you can plan accordingly:

                <h2>September to February </h2>The monsoons draw to an end in September and winter starts setting in from October. The temperature in winter months can go down to -1 °C, so make sure you carry enough woollens to keep yourself warm.
                
              <h2> December end to January</h2>  a time to enjoy snowfall and the spectacular scenic white views of the surrounding mountains, making it a favourite with the honeymooners. This is the ideal time for adventure enthusiasts who want to go skiing.
                
                <h2>March to June</h2>Summer steps in from March but the weather is still pleasant. The temperatures during these summer months usually vary between 10°C to 25°C, so you might still need light woollens during the night. This is the perfect time to indulge in outdoor activities such as paragliding, rafting, trekking and mountain adventures in the Solang Valley. This is also the time when the region’s flora is in full bloom lending it the most pristine natural beauty.
                
                <h2>July to August</h2>  Monsoons in Manali can be tricky as the region experiences heavy rainfall, which can also sometimes lead to landslides. But considering a lot of tourists don’t prefer to travel during this time, the prices of hotels tend to drop.</p>
